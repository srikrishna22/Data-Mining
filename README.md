# Data-Mining-the-Water-Table

The goal of this project was to help the Tanzanian Ministry of Water identify pumps in Tanzania that are functional, non-functional
and functional but needs repairs. This was part of a Driven Data Competion(https://www.drivendata.org/).

Overall my model does a good job of predicting which pumps fall into what category and the feature that is most useful in this task was
how old the pump is (when was it installed). See my PDF for more insights!

I'll continue to organize/update this project.
